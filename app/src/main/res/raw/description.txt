Mr Trump spoke as the UAE and Bahrain signed agreements fully normalising their relations with Israel.
The three countries hailed the deals as historic, as did Mr Trump, whose administration helped broker them.
The Gulf states are just the third and fourth Arab countries to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948.
Mr Trump hopes other countries will follow suit, but the Palestinians have urged them not to while their conflict remains unsolved.
For decades, most Arab states have boycotted Israel, insisting they would only establish ties after the Palestinian dispute was settled.

What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues?
"After decades of division and conflict we mark the dawn of a new Middle East," Mr Trump told a crowd of hundreds gathered at the White House on Tuesday.
"We're here this afternoon to change the course of history," he added.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the deals. "This day is a pivot of history; it heralds a new dawn of peace," he said.
The Israeli army said that two rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel while the ceremony was under way.
